Hey there newbie.  
Today you’ll be helping me train Ally to jump.
Use the "Headset Button" to tell her when to jump
Just watch out for bugs.  
Don’t worry, I have heavy duty bug spray.
Only...I can’t see.  
So you’ll have to aim for the spray for us.
Focus the reticle on the bugs to aim.  
I’ll handle the rest.
-----------------------------
You got us to the exit!  
Thanks for playing!
