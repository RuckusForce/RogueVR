I was able to fix the collision issue when the bullet collides with the
Enemy and the platforms. The only issue is that the bullet still has alot of power to
push the shit out of the Enemy. LOL!

FYI!
Also on the PlayerInputScript the jumping function is off because we are not using OVR gamepad
and I created a temporary "HandleJump" function for the moment. So don't be alarm.
